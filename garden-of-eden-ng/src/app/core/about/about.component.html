            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> We have several hotbeds and garding facilities in the vicinity of
                Plovdiv. We first started doing
                gardening in greater scale in 2000. Beforehand it was a small buisness tending to a few flower
                shops,
                mostly in Plovdiv. Since we started small, we know what is most desired when being in the gardening
                buisness. We hope to provide the best service to you and are always happy to have a feedback of how
                your plant has progressed. </p>
